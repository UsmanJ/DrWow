DrWow
======================

Synopsis
-----

DrWow is a web based application which allows patients to connect with doctors via the web. This will allow them to get consultations without having to wait days or weeks before their GP appointment.

For this project we used Node JS, Express, Angular JS, MongoDB, Opentok API and Mandrill API.

Below are some of the main user stories of our application.

- Users can sign up as either a doctor or patient
- Users can log in and be redirected to the appropriate portal (doctor or patient)
- Doctors can create call sessions
- Patients can join call sessions
- Doctors can view patient details
- Consultations are emailed to the patient when submitted by the doctor

Approach towards building the application
--------------------------------------

In order to build the application, we worked towards constructing an MVP. Starting by choosing the technologies to use for the application and picking the right API's for our needs. Once the technologies and API's were chosen, the team was split into two and assigned various tasks.

Two standups were conducted daily in order to discuss the progress of the project, any additional ideas, any blocks the team could have been facing and also to ensure that all members of the team were up to date with the progress of the project.

Pair programming was the route via which we built the application as it allowed knowledge to be shared efficiently and also to improve the team members communication with each other.
